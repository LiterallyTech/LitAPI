The provided example.cpp lets you plug and play (kind of) to using LitAPI for the first time. Heres a short tutorial on how to do it:

Step 1: Get the Files
The user downloads your distribution package and gets these three files:

litapi.h
litapi.lib
litapi.dll
Step 2: Create a New Project
In Visual Studio, they create a new Console App project.

Step 3: Add Files to the Project

They copy litapi.h into the project folder and add it to the project.
They copy the code above into a new file called main.cpp.
They copy litapi.lib into the project folder.
Step 4: Configure the Linker

Right-click the project -> Properties.
Go to Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies.
Add litapi.lib to the list.
Step 5: Place the DLL for Runtime

They must copy litapi.dll into the directory where the final .exe will be created (e.g., YourProject\x64\Debug).
Step 6: Compile and Run

They press F5 to build and run. The linker connects the calls in main.cpp to the litapi.lib file, and at runtime, the application loads litapi.dll to execute the actual code.

I said this as if somebody were telling me what users would do, sorry about that. im not writing this much text
