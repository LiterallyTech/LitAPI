# LitAPI
The modern way to build winapi apps.
Do you want low-level access to your window? did you ever use WinAPI?
Then you might wanna try out LitAPI because its essentially using WinAPI + Direct2D
For a modern snappy feel instead of the old WinAPI GDI way.
It also gives you access to low-level WinAPI but not all low-level access.
LitAPI is shortened version of LiterallyAPI, the real name is LiterallyAPI but
We can call it LitAPI instead.
To use LitAPI you only need the 3 provided files:

litapi.h
litapi.dll
litapi.lib

Litapi was made and tested on windows 10 with clang, but im sure it might work
With Visual Studio and other tools too.
